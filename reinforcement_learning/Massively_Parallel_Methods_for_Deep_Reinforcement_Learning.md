# Massively Parallel Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning

This is the rare workshop paper that looks useful. I think most of this stuff is
subsumed by the A3C paper, because the parallel stuff was incorporated into
there, and the "massive distributed stuff" was eliminated and shown to be
improved in the A3C paper.

However, this has the critical "human starts" metric that will be important for
future benchmarks.

TODO other notes in progress!
